# Autonomous Drone Navigation System

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive implementation of an **Autonomous Drone Navigation System**. It integrates robotics, computer vision, and real-time systems to enable autonomous navigation, path planning, and obstacle avoidance for drones. Utilizing **ROS (Robot Operating System)**, **Gazebo simulation**, and advanced algorithms like A* and Dijkstra, this system is designed to provide robust navigation capabilities. 

## Features
- **Path Planning:** Implements A* and Dijkstra algorithms for optimal route selection.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Real-time detection and avoidance using LIDAR and camera inputs.
- **Gazebo Simulation:** Realistic simulation environment for testing algorithms and scenarios.
- **Modular ROS Nodes:** Separation of functionalities for easy maintenance and scalability.
- **Visualization Tools:** Outputs visual data for debugging and performance analysis.
- **Extensibility:** Modular design allows integration with real-world drones and hardware.

## Technologies Used
